## Intro to C++ I Lab 01

**Goals**

1. Create a GitHub account

2. Begin working with Visual Studio Community (VSC)

If you are here, you now have successfully created an account on GitHub and are ready to complete this lab.

In VSC, clone Lab01 solution using the assignment invitation URL. The video on The C++ Tutorials walks you through
the cloning process. When you run the program you will see the following in an output window:

<pre>
Hello GitHub
You successfully cloned the repository
</pre>
      
Change **GitHub** to **Doug** and change **You** to **I** and then commit and push your changes. That's it.
You just completed Lab 01. Congratulations!!!
